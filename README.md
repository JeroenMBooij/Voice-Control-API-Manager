# Voice Control API Manager

This project allows users to configure a HTTP request with parameters and attach it to a voice command. For example if you have an API that can turn on the lights in multiple rooms you can send an audiofile to the Voice Control API saying, "turn on the light in room A", and the Voice Control API will send a HTTP request to the API controlling the lights with 'room A' as query paramater
